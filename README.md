# SQL Database Project: Authors and Books

## Overview

This project involves creating and managing a relational database with two main tables: `authors` and `books`. The `authors` table contains information about authors, and the `books` table stores information about books and links them to their respective authors.


## Step 1: Create Table  

The aim is to create a script that can be executed to create all the tables we need.	  

1. Books  
Each book has the following attributes/columns: Title, Description, An author, Book Id

## Output

2. Authors  
Each author has the following attributes:  First name,  Last name,  Nationality (this is an enumeration), Author Id  

## Output

## Step 2: Insert data.  

 Write a script that populates your database.  

# Create atleast 5 authors.  

## Output 
![authors](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ace6d72f-1029-4a40-a8d7-93b6205fd822)

# Create atleast 10 books.

## Output
![books](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/49bf1619-7f0c-44fc-8ac4-9eb75dee7d4c)
