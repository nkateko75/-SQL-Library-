# SQL Database Project: Authors and Books

## Overview

This project involves creating and managing a relational database with two main tables: `authors` and `books`. The `authors` table contains information about authors, and the `books` table stores information about books and links them to their respective authors.


## Step 1: Create Table  

The aim is to create a script that can be executed to create all the tables we need.	  

1. Books  
**Each book has the following attributes/columns: Title, Description, An author, Book Id.**

**Creating books' database**

CREATE DATABASE myBooks;

**Creating Books table**

CREATE TABLE books
(book_id INT PRIMARY KEY auto_increment,
title VARCHAR(100),
description  TEXT(300),
author_id INT,
FOREIGN KEY (author_id) REFERENCES authors(author_id));

**Inserting data into the authors table**

INSERT INTO authors VALUES

(1, 'John', 'Kani', 'South African'),
(2, 'Chinua', 'Achebe', 'Nigerian'),
(3, 'Haruki', 'Murakami', 'Japanese'),
(4, 'Markus', 'Zusak', 'Australian'),
(5, 'Salman', 'Rushdie', 'Indian');




###### Output

2. Authors  
**Each author has the following attributes:  First name,  Last name,  Nationality (this is an enumeration), Author Id.**

 CREATE TABLE authors
 
(
author_id INT PRIMARY KEY auto_increment,  

first_name VARCHAR(30),

last_name VARCHAR(30),

nationality ENUM ('South Africa', 'Australia', 'India', 'Nigeria', 'Japan') 
);

#### Step 2: Insert data.  

#### Create atleast 5 authors.  

**Write a script that populates your database.**

INSERT INTO authors VALUES

(1, 'John', 'Kani', 'South African'),
(2, 'Chinua', 'Achebe', 'Nigerian'),
(3, 'Haruki', 'Murakami', 'Japanese'),
(4, 'Markus', 'Zusak', 'Australian'),
(5, 'Salman', 'Rushdie', 'Indian');


###### Output 
![authors](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ace6d72f-1029-4a40-a8d7-93b6205fd822)

#### Create atleast 10 books.

**Inserting data into the books table**

INSERT  INTO books VALUES

##  Queries

#### Query 1: Total Number of Books

**Counts how many books there are in total.**

SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_books FROM books;


###### Output
![total books](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2da46799-4724-4eb8-bcd5-52c970464b3b)



#### Query 2: Author with the Most Books

**Determine which author has most books.**

SELECT A.first_name, A.last_name, COUNT(B.book_id) AS number_of_books
FROM authors A
JOIN books B ON A.author_id = B.author_id
GROUP BY A.author_id
ORDER BY number_of_books DESC
LIMIT 1;

###### Output
![most books](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b37e5061-345e-45eb-8656-85274ef4acd9)

#### Query 3: Number of Books by Nationality
SELECT A.nationality, COUNT(B.Book_id) AS number_of_books
